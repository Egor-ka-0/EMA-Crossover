Why I decided to build this project

My name is Egor. I am a high school student who enjoys mathematics, especially olympiad-style problems, and programming in Python.
Not long ago I discovered the world of quantitative finance, quantitative trading and quantitative research.
As soon as I understood that this area combines math, code and real markets, I knew I wanted to try a project in this direction, not just read about it.

After looking through different ideas online, this EMA crossover project seemed like a natural starting point.
It is considered one of the simpler building blocks in systematic trading, but it is already useful: it deals with trends, entries, exits and risk in a very concrete way.
For me, choosing this project was not about hoping for a “magic” strategy. It was about picking a realistic first step where I could:

- apply my math and Python skills to real price data;
- write a complete, well-documented small quant project from start to finish;
- build a foundation for more advanced work in quantitative finance later.
