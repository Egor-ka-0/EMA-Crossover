Why I decided to build this project

My name is Egor. I am a student with a strong interest in mathematics, Python and, more recently, quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. When I first started reading about markets, I quickly felt that I didn’t want to stay at the level of “just looking at charts” or following random patterns from social networks. I wanted to touch something that looks like the real work of quants: clear rules, data, code, and honest results.

When I came across the topic of systematic trading and moving average strategies, it immediately caught my attention. It looked like a natural first step: simple enough to implement in Python, but already connected to real questions about trends, entries, exits and risk. I didn’t want to spend weeks only reading theory. I wanted to start practicing as soon as possible and see how a rule behaves on actual historical data.

Among the possible starter ideas, this project felt like a good balance: it is one of the most basic building blocks in systematic trading, but still interesting and realistic enough to be worth doing carefully. For me, choosing this project was not about believing in a “magic” strategy. It was about choosing a concrete, manageable problem where I could:

- apply my math and programming skills to real market data;
- learn how to structure a small quant project from start to finish.
